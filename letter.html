<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
<p>
  Dear Eileen, <br>
<br>
  Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.
  I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Starting dates</h3>
<p>
We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
  <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
  <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br>
<br>
  You can find more information about <a href="https://www.codeacademy.lt/">important university dates</a> on our website.
</p>
<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
<p>
   At the Awesome Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded facility â€” as long as the subjects fall <br>
somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.).</li>
  <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the <br>
    audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
  <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>
So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
</p>
<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
<p>
Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, <br>
my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Polynesian chicken dance </dt>
  <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around<br>
  in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".</dd>
  <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle </dt>
  <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,<br>
which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
modern styles such as Twerking.
</dd>
  <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
because they were really cold.</dd><br>
</dl>

<br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
<br>
